The project titled Food Storage Prediction is an application written in R programming language which allows the user to enter the main and side ingredients of the food item, time at which the food is prepared, climate during which it is prepared, the temperature at which it will be stored, the state of the food item (dry or wet). Taking all of these factors into the account our model will predict the number of days the food is going to last
